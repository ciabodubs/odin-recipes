    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Mexican Black Beans are the perfect side dish for tacos, enchiladas, or any southwest inspired meal! They come together quickly and easily, and you will love how flavorful and delicious they are!
    </p>
    <p>I love to make these to go with Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken Tacos or Cream Cheese Chicken Enchiladas, but they are seriously so good with just about anything! Youâ€™ve gotta try them!
